Struggled to safely eject my 1TBÂ  Western Digital My Passport external hard drive in OpenSUSE. Googling regarding Western Digital was inefficient, because lots of people have been just saying not-such-a-good-things about WD products and nothing valuable regarding ejecting it.

Usual `eject` command had no success: hard drive continued to spin. I've even upgraded firmware to 1.49 on my Windows 7 machine at work. No succcess.

After some time googling I've found next working solution:

  * install `udisks` utility
  * run `sudo udisks --unmount /mount/point` from terminal
  * run `sudo udisks --detach /your/device` from terminal
  * profit

So, enjoy!
