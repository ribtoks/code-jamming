I had an interview long time ago when I was young and just started programming. I had been showing my badly written battleship game to a skilled guy in his office. It was written in Delphi but with Pascal one-big-function style and it wasn&#8217;t double buffered so it has known rendering problems. I said then &#8220;You see, it is not a chess, but..&#8221;.

In a few weeks I started writing my own chess. After 2 years they were rewritten 3 times and now they are implemented in C# using bitboards (chessboard in 64-bit integer).   
There&#8217;re some tests for AI engine, graphics in WPF, svg&#8217;s for chess figures and a lot more.

Checkout at a <a title="Queem chess engine" href="https://github.com/Ribtoks/Queem/" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>!

I have found a lot of interesting materials while writing Queem which have one leader &#8211; <a title="Chess programming" href="http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">chessprogramming wikipedia</a>. It contains everything you want to begin write your own chess.

There is also nice <a title="Rebel programming tips" href="http://www.top-5000.nl/authors/rebel/chess840.htm" target="_blank">web page</a> about Rebel, great chess program.

And a <a title="Materials for chess programming" href="http://chess.verhelst.org/1997/03/09/sources/" target="_blank">list of materials</a> about chess programming.
