If you&#8217;re a photographer new to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microstock_photography" target="_blank">microstock photography</a>, I highly reccomend you to embark this wonderful way of passive earning using your artworks. But I will suppose that you know what is this about and how basically use it. I would even suppose you&#8217;ve passed an exam on some stock agency and uploaded your first artworks. But did you know there&#8217;re plenty of stocks? And did you know it&#8217;s better to work with all major players of this industry? Shutterstock, iStock, Fotolia, Depositphotos to name just a few. And there is a lot more.

Keywording and uploading your photos to stocks can be fairly considered as the most boring part of this business. It&#8217;s quite a long way to upload your files to 10 different websites, keyword them and submit. For such a purpose I&#8217;m working on a keywording and uploading tool, called <a href="http://ribtoks.github.io/xpiks/" target="_blank">Xpiks</a>. It&#8217;s main objective is to help you to dramatically reduce time you spend on keywording and uploading and enable you to upload to more stocks simultaneously. For that reason I added features like parallel editing of several files, keywords suggestion, spell checking, automatic FTP uploading, stock requirements checking and others.

This program is open source and free and available through all major platforms: OS X, Windows and Linux.
