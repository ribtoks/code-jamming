Frequently there&#8217;s a need to quickly switch to a specific window or two from a dozen. What I usually do is I hit Alt+Tab and cycle through windows to find the one. Today I decided that it&#8217;s enough and wrote a simple productivity tool to switch to the needed windows with a hotkey. It reads a config file and gets patterns to find the needed windows and once you hit a hotkey &#8211; it brings them to front. It is especially useful when you have those &#8220;5 minutes of procrastination&#8221; and then you want to switch back to the development routine, but you need to find your IDE among windows you have opened before.

[BackToWork at GitHub](https://github.com/ribtoks/BackToWork) &#8211; just download the binaries (built for x86), edit config and you&#8217;re done.

Enjoy!
